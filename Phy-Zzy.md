Pride:
- Devotion:
	- The character’s faith in the Chaos sustains him. He is confident that there never has been nor will there ever be another follower of the cause as self-sacrificing. He believes that this grants him a special status to the Dark Gods, but is wont to rely on this instead of his own strength. 
		- Characteristic modifier: +5 Willpower, –5 Strength.
Disgrace:
- Dread:
	- Something in the Heretic’s past haunts him; a fear that dominates his life. Though he may ignore it for a time, it never leaves him completely. 
		- Characteristic modifier: +5 Perception, –5 Willpower.
