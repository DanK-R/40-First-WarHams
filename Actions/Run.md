The active character runs, covering a distance equal to his
Run Movement (see Table 9-31: Structured Time Movement).
This makes the character harder to hit with ranged weapons,
but easier prey for melee attacks. Until the beginning of the
character’s next turn, ranged attack made against him suffer
a –20 penalty to Ballistic Skill Tests, but melee attacks gain a
+20 bonus to Weapon Skill Tests.
