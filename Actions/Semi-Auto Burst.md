With cold precision, the active character shoots a burst of
semi-automatic gunfire at his enemies. The attacker must be
wielding a ranged weapon capable of semi-automatic fi re to
take this action. If the character has a pistol in each hand,
both capable of semi-automatic fi re, he may fi re both with
this action (see Two-Weapon Fighting, page 242).
The attacker makes a Ballistic Skill Test with a +0 bonus.
A dice result of 94 to 00 indicates the weapon has Jammed
(see Weapon Jams, page 245). If he hits, he scores a hit for
the initial Degree of Success plus an additional hit for every
two additional Degrees of Success. The number of extra hits
scored in this manner cannot exceed the weapon’s semiautomatic
rate of fi re. Extra hits can either be allocated to
the original target or any other targets within two metres,
provided none of the new targets would have been harder
to hit than the original target. If extra hits are allocated to
the same target, use Table 7–2: Multiple Hits to determine
the extra Hit Locations. Remember, the first hit is always
determined by reversing the numbers of the dice result made
to perform the test (see The Attack, page 244).
If the character is armed with two weapons, he may make a
secondary attack with his other weapon as part of this action.
See Two Weapon Fighting on page 242.
