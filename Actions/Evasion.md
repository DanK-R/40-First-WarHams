Evasion is a Reaction that a character can perform when it is not his Turn. After a character is hit, but before Damage is rolled, the character can attempt to avoid the attack by making a Dodge or Parry Test. A character must be aware of the attack in order to make the test. If the test succeeds, the character gets out of the way at the last moment and the attack is considered to have missed (and thus no Damage is rolled). If the Evasion Test fails, the attack connects and deals Damage normally. If the attack is a Ranged Attack, the character must test his Dodge Skill. If the attack is a Melee Attack, he may test either his Dodge or his Parry Skill. The default difficulty for this Test is Challenging (+0) before any applicable modifiers.
