Description: "–10 to WS, one hit per Degree of Success."

This action may only be taken if the attacker has the Lightning
Attack Talent. With fury and precision the attacker strikes
his target multiple times in close combat. The attacker must
be armed with a melee weapon or be able to make unarmed
attacks to take this Action. If he is armed with two melee
weapons, he may attack with both as per the rules for Two
Weapon Fighting. Unbalanced or Unwieldy melee weapons
cannot be used to make a Lightning Attack.
The attacker makes a Weapon Skill Test with a –10 bonus.
Success indicates he has hit his target with his melee weapon
once for every Degree of Success. The number of hits scored
cannot exceed the attacker’s Weapon Skill Bonus. Extra hits can
either be allocated to the original target or any other targets the
character is in melee with, provided none of the new targets
would have been harder to hit than the original target. If extra
hits are allocated to the same target, use Table 7–2: Multiple
Hits to determine the extra Hit Locations. Remember, the fi rst
hit is always determined by reversing the numbers of the dice
result made to perform the test (see The Attack, page 240).
If the attacker is wielding a second weapon in his off hand,
he may make an additional attack as part of this action. See
Two Weapon Fighting on page 242.
