Available: false
Description: "–10 to BS, one hit for every Degree of Success."
---

The character hurls a roaring burst of fully-automatic gunfire at his
enemies. The attacker must be wielding a ranged weapon capable
of fully automatic fi re to take this action. If the character has a
pistol in each hand, both capable of fully automatic fi re, he may
fi re both with this action (see Two-Weapon Fighting, page 242).
The attacker makes a Ballistic Skill Test with a –10 bonus
to his attack. If he succeeds, he scores one hit with his weapon
per Degree of Success. The number of extra hits scored in this
manner cannot exceed the weapon’s fully automatic rate of fi re.
Extra hits can either be allocated to the original target or any
other targets within two metres, provided none of the new targets
would have been harder to hit than the original target. If extra
hits are allocated to the same target, use Table 7–2: Multiple Hits
to determine the extra Hit Locations. Remember, the first hit is
always determined by reversing the numbers of the dice result
made to perform the test (see The Attack, page 240).
