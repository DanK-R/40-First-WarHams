The attacker smashes his opponent in the hopes of knocking
him off his feet. Make an Opposed Strength Test. If the
attacker wins, the target is knocked prone and must use a
Stand Action on his Turn to regain his feet. If the attacker
succeeds by two or more Degrees of Success, he may choose
to inflict 1d5â€“3+SB Damage and one level of Fatigue on the
target. If the target wins the Opposed Strength Test, he keeps
his footing. If the target wins by two or more Degrees of
Success, the attacker is knocked prone instead. If the attacker
spent a Half Action to move before performing the Knock
Down Attack, he gains a +10 bonus to the test.
