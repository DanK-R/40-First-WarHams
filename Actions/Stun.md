Description: "Try to Stun an opponent."

If the active character is unarmed or armed with a melee weapon,
he can strike to Stun instead of attempting to land a killing blow.
The attacker makes a Hard (–20) Weapon Skill Test. If the attack
succeeds, roll 1d10 and add the attacker’s Strength Bonus. This
result is compared to the targets total of his Toughness Bonus +1
per Armour Point protecting his head. If the attacker’s roll is equal
or higher, the target is stunned for a number of rounds equal to the
difference between the rolls and gains one level of Fatigue.
