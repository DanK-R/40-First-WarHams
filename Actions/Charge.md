Description: "Must move at least 4 metres, +20 to WS."
---
The character rushes at his target and delivers a single melee attack. The target must be at least four metres away, but still within the attackerâ€™s Charge Move (see Table 9-31: Structured Time Movement). The last four metres of the Charge must be in a straight line so the attacker can build speed and line up with his target. Once the attacker reaches his target, he may make one of the following Actions: a Standard Attack (melee only), Swift Attack, or All Out Attack. In doing so he follows all of the rules for these Actions, however these Actions are considered to be a part of the Charge Action. If the Charging character is unarmed, he can attempt to Grapple his opponent instead of inflicting Damage. See Grappling, page 237.
