Description: Opposed WS Test, if character wins, his next attack cannot be Dodged or Parried.
---

The character attempts to use guile and combat training to trick his opponent into a mistake. The character and his target make an Opposed Challenging (+0) Weapon Skill Test. If the active character wins, his next melee attack against that same target during this turn cannot be Evaded. If the active characterâ€™s next Action is anything other than a Melee Attack Action, the advantage of Feinting is lost.
