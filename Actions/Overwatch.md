Subtype: Attack, Concentration, Ranged
Available: true
Description: "Shoot targets coming into a set kill zone."
---

The active character guards a specific area or target, poised to
shoot at an opportune moment. When Overwatch is declared,
the active character establishes a kill zone consisting of any
general area, such as a corridor or tree line, that encompasses
a 45-degree arc in the direction that active character is facing.
The active character then specifies either Standard Attack, Full
Auto Burst, or Semi-Auto Burst, along with the conditions
under which he will perform the chosen attack. At any time the
specified conditions are met before the start of the character’s
next Turn, he can perform that attack. If this attack occurs at the
same time as another character’s Action, the character with the
higher Agility acts first. If both characters have the same Agility,
they make an Opposed Agility Test to see who acts first.
Additionally, targets caught in the kill zone must make a
Challenging (+0) Pinning Test or become Pinned (see Pinning
on page 244). If a character on Overwatch performs any Actions
or Reactions, such as Evasion, his Overwatch immediately ends.
Note this does not include Free Actions, such as speech.
