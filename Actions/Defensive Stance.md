Description: "Gain an additional Reaction, opponents suffer –20 to WS."
---
The character makes no attacks and instead concentrates entirely on self-defence. Until the start of his next Turn, the character may only use his Reactions to make the Evasion Reaction, but may make one additional Reaction, and all opponents suffer a –20 penalty to Weapon Skill Tests made to attack him.
