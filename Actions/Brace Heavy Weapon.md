Description: "Prepare to fire a heavy weapon."

Heavy weapons must be braced before they can be fired accurately. Bracing a Heavy weapon can involve using a bipod or tripod, propping the weapon up on a windowsill or sandbags, or simply assuming a wide stance or kneeling. When a Heavy weapon is fi red without being braced, the attacker suffers a â€“30 to his Ballistic Skill Test (in addition to any other penalties). Once this action is made, the weapon is braced, and remains braced until the character moves it. Once a Heavy weapon has been braced, the firer cannot move without losing the benefits of bracing. However, the user can still traverse his weapon 45 degrees (or sometimes more) depending on the
type of bracing. For example, a weapon braced in the notch of a broken wall would have a limited traverse, while a weapon with a full tripod could potentially traverse up to 180 degrees.
