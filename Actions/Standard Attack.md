The active character makes either one melee attack by testing
Weapon Skill with a +10 bonus or one ranged attack by
testing Ballistic Skill with a +10 bonus. Success inflicts one
hit on the target. For more information on making a Standard
Attack, see page 240. If the attacking character is unarmed,
he can attempt to Grapple his opponent instead of inflicting
Damage. See Grappling, page 241.
If the character is armed with two weapons, he may make a
secondary attack with his other weapon as part of this action.
See Two Weapon Fighting on page 242.
