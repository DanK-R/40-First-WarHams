Description: "Force opponents to take cover, –20 to BS."
---

The active character unleashes a devastating hail of firepower to
force his opponents to take cover. This action requires a weapon
capable of semiautomatic or fully automatic fire (see Rate of Fire,
page 147). When Suppressing Fire is declared, the active character
establishes a kill zone which is any general area, such as a corridor
or tree line, that encompasses a 45-degree arc in the direction the
active character is facing. Then, as part of the Action the character
fi res a Full Auto or Semi-Auto Burst (as per the Full-Auto and
Semi-Auto Burst Actions) and expends the appropriate ammo. All
targets within the kill zone must make a Diffi cult (–10) Pinning
Test or become Pinned (see page 244). If the attacker fi red a Full
Auto burst, the Pinning Test is Hard (–20) instead.
The character does not roll to hit following the usual
penalties or bonuses of the Full Auto and Semi-Auto Burst
Actions. Instead the character makes a Ballistic Skill Test with
a –20 penalty to see if his gunfire has hit anything. A roll of
94–100 on the test indicates the weapon has Jammed (see
Weapon Jams, page 245). If the Ballistic Skill Test succeeds,
the GM assigns the hit to a random target within the kill zone.
Furthermore, every two Degrees of Success scores an extra
hit against another random victim. Use of the Suppressive
Fire action does not affect the defensive benefi ts of armour or
cover. The number of hits scored may not exceed the weapon’s
fully automatic Rate of Fire. Use Table 7–2: Multiple Hits to
determine Hit Locations against the same target. The active
character cannot choose to fail this Ballistic Skill Test.
