Available: true
Description: Attack a specific location on the target with a –20 to WS or BS.
---
The active character attempts to attack a specific or vulnerable area on his target. The attacker declares a location on his target (e.g., Head, Body, Left Arm, Right Arm, Left Leg, or Right Leg)
and makes an attack following all the rules for Standard Attacks, except the test is either a Hard (–20) Weapon Skill or Ballistic Skill Test (depending on whether the attack is melee or ranged).
(Therefore, he does not get the usual +10 bonus for Standard Attacks.) If he succeeds, he skips the Determine Hit Location step of the attack and instead hits the declared location. At the GM’s
discretion, this attack may be used to aim at specific locations on monsters or within the environment, such as shooting a door lock from across the room or disabling a wall-mounted vid-recorder.
