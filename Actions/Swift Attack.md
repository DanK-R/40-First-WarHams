Type: Half Action
Subtype: Attack, Melee
Available: false
Description: "+0 to WS, additional hit for every two additional Degrees of Success."
---

This action may only be taken if the attacker has the Swift Attack
Talent. With fury and precision the attacker strikes his target
multiple times in close combat. The attacker must be armed with
a melee weapon or be able to make unarmed attacks to take this
Action. If he is armed with two melee weapons, he may attack
with both as per the rules for Two Weapon Fighting.
The attacker makes a Weapon Skill Test with a +0 bonus.
Success indicates he has hit his target with his melee weapon
once for the initial Degree of Success, plus once for every
two additional Degrees of Success. The number of hits scored
cannot exceed the attacker’s Weapon Skill Bonus. Extra hits can
either be allocated to the original target or any other targets the
character is in melee with, provided none of the new targets
would have been harder to hit than the original target. If extra
hits are allocated to the same target, use Table 7–2: Multiple
Hits to determine the extra Hit Locations. Remember, the fi rst
hit is always determined by reversing the numbers of the dice
result made to perform the test (see The Attack below).
If the character is armed with two weapons, he may make a
secondary attack with his other weapon as part of this action.
