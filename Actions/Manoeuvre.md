---

By using superior footwork and aggression, the attacker can
force his opponent to move by making an Opposed Weapon
Skill Test with his opponent. If he succeeds, the opponent
must move one metre in the direction of the attackerâ€™s choice.
If desired, the attacker can advance one metre as well. The
opponent cannot be forced into another character or some
other obstacle (such as wall).
