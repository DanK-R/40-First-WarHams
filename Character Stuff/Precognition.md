## Description: 
The psyker’s mind skims the warp for glimpses of the immediate future, seeking to discern threats to himself so that he may avoid them. Many latent psykers are unknowing of the gift they possess, considering their survival to be a matter of luck, while Eldar seers describe it as an act of defi ance against the fate-weaving Crone Goddess, Morai-Heg. While this power remains in effect, the psyker gains a bonus to all Evasion Tests equal to twice his Psy Rating.
